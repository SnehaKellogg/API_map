1. The temperature seems to be highly correlated with the latitude. From south to equator, there is very little but significant variation with tempertaure rising as we move near the equator. However, as we move north of the equator, the temperature drops with much higher slope. 
The near equator cities also seem to have much lesser variation in the temperature as compared to those far from equator. 
2. For the sample selected, the humidity level is usually 30% or more as we move away from the equator, whereas the cities nearby centre has few with very low humidity as well. 
3. The wind speed has much more variation when we move away from equator. The average wind speed is higher as we move away from centre but a larger set still has the same wind speed. For states in centre, the highest wind speed is much lower than those farther from equator.
